	<paragraph>My name is Jonathan Greenbaum, I am a student of Montgomery college and I am 19 years old looking for a job requiring Tech skills for website development and/or coding. Taking to things like coding and development started at a young age, I was obsessed with video games growing up to an extent that I wanted to create them myself, and to do so I needed to learn to code. The reason I applied for this job position is because it seems like good experience in field work for coding and programming.

	<header>Pros and Cons:</header><br>
<br>
	<video src="../OneDrive/Pictures/Camera Roll/question 4.mp4" controls width="650" height="375"></video>
<br>

<paragraph>Some of the weaknesses I have consist of struggling to get work done sometimes, usually I am able to get things done but every now and then I struggle to finish a piece of work or project on time. Another problem I have is I sometimes have a hard time asking for help if I need it. Both are things I still need to work on which I have been getting better at. Most recent examples of improvement have been around the end of the first semester in the college I am enrolled at.<br><br>
I also am an open listener and a visual learner. If something is done in front of me I can probably recreate it.

<br>
<paragraph>In older jobs I have had working in fast food were heavily in a team effort. When I worked at a pizza place, we needed all hands on deck for the superbowl and needed to keep a consistent pace and to constantly switch roles. At any given moment we needed quick communication in order to get things done.</paragraph><br>
<br>
<header>Where I see myself in five years:</header><br>
	<video src="../OneDrive/Pictures/Camera Roll/quetsion 7.mp4" controls width="650" height="375"></video>
<br>
<paragraph>Hopefully within five years I hope to graduate college and become an independent developer for video games being able to make projects for the world to experience. I hope to find people who will be able to help make these projects and create a good name for myself or at least get a good start in the video game industry.</paragraph><br>
