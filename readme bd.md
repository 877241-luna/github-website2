in this file I made a birthday card for my grandpa in the form of a website using three moving gifs and a video found on youtube.com

I used flex so the words and images would adjust based on the size of the screen

I used an email contanier for the background to make it look like a piece of paper.

I put the images under a category titled gifts so they would all have the same proporties and sizes.

to open the project you need to access my github homepage and click on the file that says "grandpa birthday"

I could not use copyrightten images but I was able to find a royalty free video
