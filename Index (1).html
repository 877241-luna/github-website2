<p>Let's learn HTML.

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it's the foundational language used to create and structure content on the web.

What HTML Does
• 	Structures web pages: HTML defines elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, and more.
• 	Works with other technologies: HTML teams up with CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity) to build rich, dynamic websites.</p>

<p> One of my favorite hobbies is to play chess. </p>
